<header><b>Introduction</b></header>
<p>More than at any other time in history, the future of humankind is being shaped by issues that are beyond any one nation’s ability to solve. Climate change, avian flu, financial instability, terrorism, waves of migrants and refugees, water scarcities, disappearing fisheries, stark and seemingly intractable poverty—all of these are examples of global issues whose solution requires cooperation among nations. Each issue seems at first to be little connected to the next; the problems appear to come in all shapes and from all directions. But if one reflects a moment on these examples, some common features soon become apparent:
<ul type="square">
<li>Each issue affects a large number of people on different sides of national boundaries.</li>
<li>Each issue is one of significant concern, directly or indirectly, to all or most of the countries of the world, often as evidenced by a major U.N.declaration or the holding of a global conference on the issue.</li>
<li>Each issue has implications that require a global regulatory approach;
no one government has the power or the authority to impose a solution,
and market forces alone will not solve the problem.</li></ul>

These commonalities amount almost to a definition of “global issue,” and awareness of them will help throughout this book in identifying other suchissues besides those named above. First, however, a few other definitions and distinctions will further clarify just what we mean by global issues.

<header><b>Some Definitions</b></header>
Global issues, globalization, and global public goods are related but differing concepts. Globalization generally refers to the increasing integration of economies around the world, particularly through trade, production chains (where parts for a final good, such as an automobile, are produced in one country and assembled in another), and financial flows. The term increasingly also refers to the movement of people and of information (including not only financial and other raw data but ideas, fashions, and culture as well) across international borders. Globalization can be understood as a driving force affecting many global issues, from migration to fair trade to debt relief.
<br>
The concept of global public goods is a more recent one, and indeed its dimensions and implications are still being worked out by researchers and policy analysts. The International Task Force on Global Public Goods has defined “international public goods” (a term that includes both global and regional public goods) as goods and services that “address issues that: (i) are deemed to be important to the international community, to both developed and developing countries; (ii) typically cannot, or will not, be adequately addressed by individual countries or entities acting alone; and, in such cases (iii) are best addressed collectively on a multilateral basis.”1 By this definition, most but not all of the global issues addressed in this book involve the creation of—or the failure to create—global public goods. We will return to the topic of global public goods later in the chapter.

<header><b>What Global Issues Do we face today?</b></header>
<p>Global issues are present in all areas of our lives as citizens of the world. 
hey affect our economies, our environment, our capabilities as humans, and our processes for making decisions regarding cooperation at the global level (which this book will call global governance). These issues often turn out to be
interconnected, although they may not seem so at first. For example, energy consumption drives climate change, which in turn threatens marine fisheries through changes in ocean temperature and chemistry, and other food resources through changes in rainfall patterns. For purposes of this book we group global issues into the five thematic areas shown in Table 1.1. Of course, there are also other possible categorizations and other approaches to global issues.

Not all of the issues listed in Table 1.1 are discussed in this book. Rather, we have tried to cover the most important ones in each of the categories in Table 1.1 where the World Bank has  expertise. Global issues in the area of peace and security are also very important but are beyond the expertise and mandate of the World Bank. The book therefore has four parts, covering the
global economy, global human development, the global environment and natural resources, and global governance. Each part has several chapters, each of which covers one of the global issues listed in Table 1.1.

Each chapter begins by defining the issue and identifying what makes it global in scope. The chapter then explores the key underlying forces that shape the issue, the consequences of addressing or not addressing it, and possible solutions, controversies, and international actions already under way or proposed. Each chapter ends with a brief review of the World Bank’s own
perspectives on the issue and its role in seeking solutions. What follows is a brief introduction to the four thematic areas and the global issues discussed within each.
 </p>

</section>

<section class="main-section" id="The Global Economy">
<header><b>The Global Economy</b></header>
<p>National and regional economies around the world are becoming increasingly integrated with each other through trade in goods and services, transfer of technology, and production chains. The interconnectedness of financial markets is also expanding rapidly. Such integration offers greater opportunity for people to tap into more and larger markets around the world, and so increase both their incomes and their ability to enjoy all that the world economy has to offer.
<br>
At the same time, however, economic integration poses serious inherent risks: in a globalized world economy, an adverse event such as a financial crisis in one part of the world can easily spread to other parts, just as a contagious disease spreads from person to person. An example of such contagion was the East Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, in which a financial and currency crisis in Thailand quickly triggered similar upheavals in the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, and elsewhere, prompting international intervention to avert a global crisis. (See Chapter 3 for more about the East Asian and other financial crises.) Another example involves the globalization of trade and labor markets: Concerns about the fairness of recent international trade agreements and about the effects of freer trade on jobs and working conditions led to violent protests at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999; these protests helped change the dynamic of the latest round of international trade negotiations. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion of these ongoing negotiations.) There are also concerns that the world economy is growing in an unbalanced way, with rising inequalities in incomes and opportunities. Part One of the book is devoted to those global issues that fall under the heading of the global economy. Of the many issues that could be addressed,the book considers the following: poverty and inequality, financial stability,
debt, migration, trade, and food security.
 
</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Poverty and Inequality">
<header><b>Poverty and Inequality</b></header>
<p>Substantial progress has been made in recent decades in reducing poverty the proportion of people living in extreme poverty worldwide has halved since 1980. Yet poverty remains deep and widespread: more than a billion people still subsist on less than one dollar a day, and income per capita in the world’s high-income countries, on average, is 65 times that in the low income
countries.
<br>
Income is not the only measure of poverty, nor is it the only one for which
the recent numbers are grim. Over three-quarters of a billion of the world’s
people, many of them children, are malnourished. Whereas the rich countries
have an average of 3.7 physicians per 1,000 populations, the low-income countries
have just 0.4 per 1,000. Maternal mortality in childbirth in many low-income African countries is more than 100 times higher than in the high-income countries of Europe. Vast numbers of people also struggle to survive
in squalid, depressing living conditions, where they lack both opportunity to better their lives and the social recognition and voice to demand such opportunity.
<br>
<img src="Images/042331ffbbb5feaa98cc267a14b989a3.jpg" width="1000" height="500">

These, too, are real and important aspects of poverty.
Accompanying widespread poverty is widespread inequality, again as measured both by income and by other yardsticks. Measured in absolute terms, the income gap between rich and poor countries has widened over the last several decades. The economic divide within countries is likewise large.
<br>
In an increasingly interdependent world, the high prevalence and stubborn persistence of poverty and inequality in developing countries—the subject of Chapter 2 of this volume—have implications for all countries. Deep deprivation weakens the capacity of states to combat terrorism, organized crime, armed conflict, and the spread of disease, and these in turn can have severe economic, environmental, and security consequences for neighboring states and the global community. Poverty and inequality and their associated outcomes can no longer be contained within national boundaries. This makes them a global problem of huge proportions, and it means that alleviating poverty and reducing inequality are critical to maintaining and strengthening regional and global stability. That is why the United Nations has made reducing world poverty a top priority—it is a target under the first of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted at the U.N. Millennium Summit—and it is why the World Bank takes as its fundamental mission to build a world free of poverty.</p>
</section>

<section class="main-section" id="Financial Stability">
<header><b>Financial Stability</b></header>
<p>The emergence of a global, market-based financial economy has brought considerable benefits to those middle-income countries at the forefront of economic reform and liberalization—the so-called emerging market economies.<br>
Thanks largely to the opening of the financial sector in these countries, investors in other countries can now better diversify their investment choices across domestic and international assets, increasing their expected rate of return. Businesses within these countries, meanwhile, are better able to finance promising ideas and fund their expansion plans. As a result, financial
resources worldwide are invested more efficiently, boosting economic growth and living standards on both sides of these transactions.<br>
But, as Chapter 3 argues, the globalization of financial markets has proved to be a double-edged sword. Even in those countries where liberalization has been a tonic for economic growth, it has also raised the real risk of financial crisis. The most controversial aspect of financial liberalization involves the liberalization of portfolio flows, especially short-term borrowing.
The dangers were brought into sharp focus during the East Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, mentioned above: The failure of financial systems in that episode imposed high economic and social costs, such as rampant unemployment, increased migration, social conflict, and social instability—and not only in the countries directly affected. In the wake of
this and other crises, an urgent debate has been launched over reform of the international financial architecture to reduce the chances of further financial instability.</p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Debt Relief and Debt Sustainability">
<header><b>Debt Relief and Debt Sustainability</b></header>
For the world’s poorest countries, foreign aid and the ability to take on foreign debt present a valuable opportunity to invest in their own development.<br>

But foreign borrowing poses great disadvantages as well as great advantages. On the one hand, when the proceeds of public borrowing are invested wisely, directed at the right policies and programs, they can indeed promote more rapid development. On the other hand, too much borrowing, or any borrowing that is not undertaken prudently, can act as a drag on the economy, as precious funds must then be devoted to debt service rather than to serving the country’s development needs. As Chapter 4 explains, debt that is rising rapidly relative to a country’s output or exports can threaten that country’s very future.<br>
<br>
This threat became increasingly and painfully evident in the case of a number of low-income countries in the 1980s and 1990s. Their plight sparked an international advocacy campaign, popularly know as the Jubilee movement, to forgive the debts of the poorest countries with huge debt burdens. This campaign led in turn to the launch of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996, to address the excessive debt burdens of the world’s poorest nations. Since then, 38 of these countries, 32 of them in Sub-Saharan Africa, have qualified or potentially qualify for HIPC assistance, and of these, 18 are now receiving irrevocable debt relief and 10 are receiving interim relief.<br>

The rest have been beset by persistent social difficulties that make debt relief infeasible for now. However, at their summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, in 2005, the leaders of the Group of Eight major industrial nations pledged to eventually write off 100 percent of the debt of the poorest African countries. In line with this proposal, officially known as the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, efforts are under way to provide $37 billion in debt relief to countries that are at the HIPC completion stage.</section>

<section class="main-section" id="International Migration">
<header><b>International Migration</b></header>
<p>Increasing flows of people across national borders are both a contributor to and a consequence of a more interconnected world. About 180 million people worldwide already live outside their country of birth, and pressure for international migration will continue, driven by differences in demographics and real incomes between countries. Research shows that although the largest economic gains from immigration accrue to the immigrants themselves, the international migration of labor can also benefit both the countries receiving immigrants and the countries sending them, and that on balance it boosts world income and reduces poverty. In the receiving countries, migrants can fill labor shortages in certain industries. In the sending countries, they can help ease unemployment and other social pressures while increasing financial inflows, in the form of remittances from the migrants to their families back home. Remittances also help level out the distribution of income both within and across countries. Worldwide remittances have doubled in the last decade, reaching $216 billion in 2004, according to official statistics, of which $151billion is estimated to have gone to developing countries. Actual remittances
are most likely higher, because remittances through informal channels fail tobe counted.<br>

<img src="Images/fcee6001cfe24a6ae07428db71c3f0a7.jpg" width="1000" height="500">

Migration is not without its costs, however. For the migrants themselves, the journey itself and the search for fair employment and humane treatment in the host country can be arduous and risky. The host country government may bear added costs to assimilate the migrants, and wages for some native workers may fall. The home country may suffer a loss of valuable skilled workers. The sum of these and other costs depends, of course, on the number of migrants, and so the major issues surrounding international migration today, which Chapter 5 examines, are how to help countries adapt to largescale migration and how to improve its global development impact. Equitable migration is also ultimately linked to other broader issues such as poverty
reduction and human rights, making it a global concern.</p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="International Trade">
<header><b>International Trade</b></header>
<p>In an ever more integrated world economy, international trade matters more than ever before. As Chapter 6 argues, a robust and equitable trading system is central to the fight against global poverty, because it drives economic growth and provides jobs in developing countries where they are sorely needed. Measured by the volume of goods and services traded, world trade continues to grow, and just since 2000, the exports of developing countries as a group have increased their share of world markets by more than a fifth, fromn 19 percent to 23 percent. Yet growth in trade in many low-income countries has long been held back by protectionist policies in the more developed countries. Many rich countries offer subsidies to politically favored domestic industries such as sugar, textiles, apparel, and steel. These subsidies are a serious barrier to low-income countries’ exports.

The Doha Development Round of multilateral trade talks, now under way under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO), is the first such round to place developing country interests at the center of the negotiations. Although progress on the Doha round stalled following the collapse of the September 2003 WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancún, Mexico, WTO members have committed themselves to make progress as the talks proceed.
Delivering on the promise of lowering tariffs as well as nontariff barriers in both developed and developing countries could stimulate worldwide increases in income that would lift an estimated 144 million people out of
poverty.</p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Food Security">
<header><b>Food Security</b></header>
<p>In a world of growing prosperity and agricultural abundance, about 800 million people still do not get enough to eat. Eliminating hunger is thus one of the most fundamental challenges facing humanity. The challenge is a complex one—so much so that this book devotes two chapters to unraveling its multiple dimensions. As Chapter 7 explains, the task of reducing hunger—another one of the targets under the first of the MDGs—is shaped by interlinked issues of food availability, access to food, food security, and distribution. Food availability refers to the supply of food, whether at the global, regional, national, or local level, without regard to the ability of individuals to acquire it. Sources of supply may include production within the household, domestic commercial food production, food stocks accumulated in earlier periods, commercially purchased imports, and food aid. There are presently no signs of a food availability problem at the global level. In fact, global food production has more than kept pace with growing world population in recent decades, increasing in per capita terms by 0.9 percent annually and even faster in such populous developing countries as China and India.
<br>
In most circumstances the main cause of food insecurity is not lack of availability but lack of access at the household level: because of weak purchasing power and insufficient household agricultural production—both
characteristics associated with poverty—millions of people cannot obtain enough of the food that is available locally to meet their dietary needs. And even access to sufficient food at the household level does not guarantee that all individuals will have an adequate food intake. That depends upon the distribution of food among household members, methods of food preparation, dietary preferences, and mother-child feeding habits—issues taken up further in Chapter 10.</p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Human Development">
<header><b>Human Development</b></header>
<p>Part Two of the book covers three global issues related to the development and preservation of human capability: communicable diseases, education, and malnutrition. The Human Development Reports team has defined the task of human development as “creating an environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accord with their needs and interests.”4 Building human capabilities through education, health services, and access to resources and knowledge is fundamental to human development. Most of the actions needed lie within the domain of national governments, but broad-based human development also has significant externalities, or spillover effects, that make it a global issue. Education, good health, and good nutrition are all vital not only for the earning capacity and general well-being of individuals, but also for the prosperity of national economies and, in a globalizing world, for the global economy. Controlling the global spread of diseases is determined in part by the effectiveness of national public health programs, but also by the degree of international cooperation in containing outbreaks, and the weakest link in the chain determines the risk for all. The importance of education, health, and nutrition both for individuals and for human society at all levels explains why several of the MDGs focus on these human development issues.</p></section>


<section class="main-section" id="Communicable Diseases">
<header><b>Communicable Diseases</b></header>
<p>HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria are just a few of the infectious diseases that continue to plague humankind, especially in the developing world. Meanwhile new threats such as avian flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) continue to emerge. With essential vaccines and immunizations still underprovided in many developing countries, communicable diseases are an international public health issue that has caught the attention of the global public and its leaders. There is increasing global awareness that communicable diseases do not respect national borders, and that how these diseases are dealt with in developing countries has consequences both for global public health and for the global economy.<br>

As Chapter 8 reports, this view is well grounded in years of research, which has produced some important breakthroughs but also reported some dismaying findings: 40 million people worldwide are now infected with HIV, and those infected experience a decline in life expectancy of 6 to 7 years on average; communicable diseases represent 7 of the top 10 causes of child mortality in developing countries, even though 90 percent of these deaths are avoidable. Improvements in global public health not only promise relief from human suffering on a vast scale, but also have important economic benefits, as reductions in mortality, reduced incidence of disease, improved nutrition leading to improved intellectual capacity, and other gains feed through to a larger, more productive, and more capable world labor force.</p></section>


<section class="main-section" id="Education">
<header><b>Education</b></header>
<p>In today’s global economy, education has become more vital than ever before in determining whether people, their local communities, and their countries achieve their potential and prosper. The world economy is undergoing changes that make it much more difficult for individuals in any country to thrive without the skills and tools that a quality education provides. This is particularly important for the poor, who rely on their skills and labor as their way out of poverty.<br>
    <img src="Images/images.jpg" width="1000" height="500">

As Chapter 9 explains, these changes present new challenges and opportunities for educators and educational systems, and the stakes are tremendously high. The choices that countries make today about education could lead to sharply divergent outcomes in the decades ahead. Countries that respond astutely should experience extraordinary educational progress, with major social and economic benefits, including “catch-up” gains for the poor and marginalized. Countries that fail to recognize the challenge and respond to it risk stagnating or even slipping backward, widening social and economic gaps and sowing the seeds of unrest.</p></section>
<section class="main-section" id="Malnutrition">
<header><b>Malnutrition</b></header>
<p>As Chapter 10 reminds us, malnutrition remains the world’s most serious health problem and the single biggest contributor to child mortality. Nearly one-third of all children in the developing world are either underweight or stunted, and more than 30 percent of the developing world’s population suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. Without investments to reduce malnutrition, many countries will fail to achieve the MDGs, and other major international efforts in health may be derailed. In Sub-Saharan Africa, malnutrition rates are increasing, and in South Asia, which has the highest prevalence of undernutrition of any region, the situation is improving only slowly.<br>

<img src="Images/25410fe322de339abab1b92260787f10.jpg" width="1000" height="500">

There is now unequivocal evidence that workable solutions to the malnutrition problem are available. An example is the strikingly low cost with which micronutrients could be provided to those in need of them: one estimate is that all of Africa’s micronutrient needs could be met for a mere $235 million a year. Indeed, interventions such as these have been shown to be excellent\ economic investments. The May 2004 “Copenhagen Consensus” of eminent economists, which included a number of Nobel laureates, concluded that, among a lengthy list of interventions proposed to meet the world’s myriad development challenges, nutrition interventions pay some of the highest returns.<br></p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Global Environment and Natural Resources">
<header><b>Global Environment and Natural Resources</b></header>
<p>Part Three of the book focuses on issues related to conserving and more equitably sharing the planet’s environmental and natural resources in ways that meet present needs without undermining future uses. This is the essence of environmental sustainability—a concept reflected in yet another of the MDGs. Resources such as a stable world climate, energy, clean fresh water, fisheries, and forests are all part of the global commons, and all are already under stress. Those stresses will only become more intense as world population and incomes increase, and as today’s developing countries follow consumption paths taken decades earlier by the developed countries. Yet addressing the challenges of sustainable resource use is hampered by a sobering reality: many of the world’s resources are global public goods, which means (as discussed below) that individuals and individual nations acting only in their self-interest will fail to take fully into account the implications of their consumption for the well-being of other people and other countries. In the absence of foresightful and globally coordinated policies, exploitation of these resources can easily become a race to grab whatever one can grab before nothing is left. The chapters in this part of the book discuss these issues of how to manage shared global resources and use them in a sustainable fashion.</p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Climate Change">
<header><b>Climate Change</b></header>
<p>Virtually all climate scientists now agree that climate change is occurring and is due largely to human activity, and that further change is inevitable. Recent studies indicate that human activity over the last 100 years has triggered a historically unprecedented rise in global surface temperatures and ocean levels, with a worrisome acceleration particularly over the last two decades. The consequences will affect billions of people, particularly in poor countries and in subtropical regions, through decreases in agricultural productivity, increased incidence of flooding and of severe weather events, an expanded range of waterborne diseases, loss of biodiversity, and a number of other effects. Beyond this, if the global climate is pushed far out of balance, it may become launched on an irreversible course toward catastrophe, with worldwide repercussions.</p></section>
<img src="Images/images(1).jpg" width="1000" height="500">

<section class="main-section" id="Energy">
<header><b>Energy</b></header>
<p>The world economy of 2035 will be three to four times its present size, thanks largely to rising incomes in developing countries. Even if dramatic improvements in energy efficiency are achieved, this vastly expanded activity will consume much more energy than the world uses today. Pressures to supply enough fossil fuel, biomass, and electricity to meet world demand will therefore only get worse. World economic activity must become radically less carbon intensive, to avoid not only environmental disaster through climate change, but also health disasters on an epic scale, as cities in the developing world choke under a fog of pollution. A shift to renewable energy and low- or no-carbon fuels is essential, as are the development and adoption of energy efficient technologies.</p></section>


<section class="main-section" id="Water">
<header><b>Water</b></header>
<p>During the past century, while world population has tripled, the use of fresh water for human consumption, agriculture, and other activities has increased six fold. Some rivers that formerly reached the sea no longer do so—all of the water is diverted to human use before it reaches the river’s mouth. Half the world’s wetlands have disappeared in the same period, and today 20 percent of freshwater species are endangered or extinct. Many important aquifers are being depleted, and water tables in many parts of the world are dropping at an alarming rate. Worse still, world water use is projected to increase by about 50 percent in the next 30 years. It is estimated that, by 2025, 4 billion people—half the world’s population at that time—will live under conditions of severe water stress, with conditions particularly severe in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. Currently, an estimated 1.1 billion people lack access to safe water, 2.6 billion are without adequate sanitation, and more than 4 billion do not have their wastewater treated to any degree. These numbers are likely to only grow worse in the coming decades.<br>

This potentially bleak outlook makes water supply a critical issue and one that cuts across national and regional economies and many productive sectors.
Many observers predict that disputes over scarce water resources will fuel an increase in armed conflicts. The issue has fortunately caught the attention of policymakers and, as discussed in Chapter 13, efforts are under way both at the national and the international level to address water scarcity issues.</p></section>

<section class="main-section" id="Conclusion">
    <header><b>Conclusion</b></header>
<p> To conclude, it is clear that how today’s global issues are addressed, or not addressed, will have a profound impact on the shape of the future world in which we all will live. Yet, as noted above, there is no global government to address these global issues, set global public policies and priorities, collect taxes on a worldwide basis, and allocate resources accordingly. Thus progress on most of these issues depends on a deliberate—and deliberative—process of building international consensus for collective action.
